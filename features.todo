- wasm file hot reload:
  - add a route to trigger the wasm file reload
  - it's a POST request with a token (reload-token)
  - into the map: load a new instance of plugin, remove the previous one
- health check
- orchestrator (choose another name): but kiss, an API to:
  - spawn a simplism process
  - get the list of the processes
  - kill a simplism process
  - reload the wasm file of a process
