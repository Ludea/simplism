- health check
- orchestrator (choose another name): but kiss, an API to:
  - spawn a simplism process
  - get the list of the processes
  - kill a simplism process
  - reload the wasm file of a process
- check if it's doable to use the plugin var method (type?) to do something like actors+messages
